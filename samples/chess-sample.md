# Introduction

There are a number of common mistakes that might arise in low level play, but are almost never seen at the master level. It is assumed that any strong player should be aware of the specifics of these errors, and be able to handily dismiss opponents who make them. Not only because there is a clear opportunity for increasing one's rating, but because a good understanding of the structural flaws that result from common, seemingly natural moves is an important skill in chess.

Even when the basics of a refutation are known, winning the full point may still require some skill and memory. More importantly, experience with the position, and some small amount of practice may be helpful. Unfortunately, sometimes players who are rapidly improving may find that they have gaps in their knowledge of these refutations as a result of a lack of experience playing against common mistakes from lower levels. They have "leapfrogged" a level of skill, but missed out on some important lessons.

Cheap tricks deserve cheap punishments, but a strong player does not rise to the master level without paying his dues. He must be impervious to cheap tricks, and also must have an encyclopedic knowledge of pitfalls, and their punishments.

When an early mistake appears on the board, it may not lead to the most exciting games of chess. However uninteresting, a thorough knowledge of refutations is essential. Many times, failure to punish a weak ploy results in a substantially worse position, not just a missed opportunity.

One example arises commonly in low level play, in the French Defense, Advance variation, while another in the Sicilian. Both examples are for black, and in the Sicilian example, in particular, correct punishment is particularly important.

## The French Defense, Advance Variation

For example, in the Advance variation, there is a common mistake.

```rawtex
\newchessgame
\mainline{1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Qb6 6.Be3}
```
A blunder, but one with a very specific punishment:

`\chessboard`

`\mainline{6...Qxb2}`

`\chessboard`

Only `\mainline{7.Nbd2}` is a natural move that allows the game continue without losing the rook. It's worth noting that both:

`\variation[level=2]{7.dxc4}` and `\variation[level=2]{7.Qb3}` are more stubborn.

`\mainline[level=1]{7...c4}` a curiously one slow move, that stands out above all other possibilities to crush all hope. Other moves simply win a pawn, but the text move demonstrates the mistake in the most convincing manner.

`\chessboard`

White's light square bishop cannot be developed. Black can bring the g1 Knight into play at his leisure. The c3 and a2 pawn cannot both be saved. The black queen cannot usefully be harassed since both `\variation[level=2]{8.Rb1 Qxc3}` and `\variation[level=2]{8.Qb1 Qxc3}` are bad.

`\mainline[level=1]{8.Rc1 Qxa2}` There is nothing better.

`\chessboard`

Black's main idea is now to push b4, for example: `\mainline[level=1]{9.Be2 b5}` then retreat the Queen to **d8** or **c7** via **a5**, develop the **g8** knight via **e7** to **f5** where it will be very strong. The strong central pawns entomb white, who cannot organize the usual kingside attack, ensuring black will have plenty of time to castle short, develop the bishops, and win on the queenside, with rooks and bishops, where he will remain dominant with decent play.

## The Sicilian Defense, Sveshnikov

After a long theoretical opening:

```rawtex
\newchessgame
\mainline{1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Nd5 Bg7 11.Bd3 Be6 12.O-O O-O 13.c4 bxc4 14.Nxc4}
```

The following position appears on the board:

`\chessboard`

What to do? Pushing **f4-f5** is a typical idea and strongest. After all, the black kings position is quite odd, although not especially so for frequent players of this defense. The fact that the usual pawn in front of the king is replaced by a bishop means that dynamic defense is necessary, and that a kingside onslaught is always a possibility.

Still, the **d4** square is a tempting outpost. Cannot `\variation[level=2]{14...f5}` wait for another move? If `\mainline[level=1]{14...Nd4}` unfortunately black is too slow, and the outpost is of no consequence. `\variation[level=1]{15.Qh5}` is enough to win, in view of `\variation[level=1]{15...f5 16.exf5 Bxd5 17.f6}`.

`\chessboard`

In the game, White managed to win at a more leisurely pace. `\mainline[level=1]{15.Nce3 Re8 16.Rc1 Ra7 17.Qh5 f5 18.exf5 Bxd5 19.Nxd5}` and then even `\mainline[level=1]{19...e4}` was not enough to save him, after `\mainline[level=1]{20.f6 Bxf6 21.Rc8 Qxc8 22.Nxf6+}` led to a brutal bloodbath.

`\chessboard`

Black failed to learn the importance of pushing **f5** early in this variation. The move has many purposes, it threatens the pawn on **e4** and after, the Knight on **d5**. It also serves a defensive purpose. White always has the possibility of **Qa5**, and then to continue the attack with the Knights. Blacks f pawns will be doubled. This blocks the black Queen, or any other pieces from assisting in the defense. Since the g pawn is missing, black has little hope of resisting.

These attacks are not often seen in high level play, just like the pattern from the French Defense is nearly absent from any strong databases. Nevertheless, such mistakes take place frequently in amateur play, and when they do appear in higher rated games, it is nearly certain that a younger, less experienced player is on the losing end.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering the refutation of common mistakes is an essential part of a chess player's journey to becoming a strong, formidable opponent. These errors, often overlooked or underestimated at lower levels of play, must be thoroughly understood and swiftly exploited by anyone aspiring to reach the master level. The process involves not just theoretical knowledge but also practical experience and a keen awareness of typical pitfalls and their appropriate punishments. This depth of understanding ensures that one remains impervious to simplistic tricks and can convert even unexciting positions into decisive victories. As such, paying one's dues through diligent study and practice is non-negotiable for those who aim to excel in chess. By methodically addressing these gaps in knowledge and honing the ability to capitalize on opponents' mistakes, a player solidifies their foundation and enhances their overall strategic acumen, paving the way for sustained success in the game.
